# Calculation of EMG envelope and statistical parametric mapping analysis of averaged repetitions throughout movement cycle.

## data.zip
- example data: text files of emg data (RMS values)
- collected from 3 subjects in 2 conditions (norm/exo) with multiple electrodes
- contains markers to indicate reps and concentric and eccentric phases

## spm-analysis
- averages marked reps per subject and through all subjects
- uses moving average smoothing
- plots emg envelope with spm (https://spm1d.org/index.html)
